While the fHDHR reops share very little code from the below projects, they were a source of inspiration:

  * [tvhProxy by jkaberg](https://github.com/jkaberg/tvhProxy)
  * [locast2plex by tgorgdotcom](https://github.com/tgorgdotcom/locast2plex)


Aside from the above, these other projects are worth a look as well:

* [npvrProxy](https://github.com/rogueosb/npvrProxy)
* [xTeVe](https://xteve.de/)
* [telly](https://github.com/tellytv/telly)
* [dizquetv](https://github.com/vexorian/dizquetv)
